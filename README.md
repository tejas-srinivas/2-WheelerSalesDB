1. The purpose of the Vehicle Booking Management System is to automate the existing manual system with the help of computerized equipment and full-fledged computer          software, fulfilling requirements so that their valuable data/information can be stored for a longer period with easy access and manipulation of records in the          Database. The required software and hardware are easily available and easy to work with. Our project 2 Wheeler Sales Management System includes a home page that          allows users to check the availability of Vehicles once logged in (requires registration).Our management system provides encrypted password for the users which is not    accessible by superuser also. 

2. Using this software, we can check the availability of desired vehicles,also view Ex-Showroom price of the respective vehicles that are available.Our Management System    provides a user-friendly interface to book/buy vehicles. 
 
3. The Vehicle Management System portal (i,e Administrator) can be accessed using the username and password of the admin (superuser). 
5. As mentioned above the interface we have created is very user-friendly. 
6. The portal contains a dashboard which gives insights such as users,bookings,revenue etc.
7. Vehile Database Management System, as described above, can lead to an error-free, secure, reliable, and fast management system. It can assist the user to concentrate    on their other activities rather than record keeping. 

   Thus, it will help the organization in better utilization of resources. The organization can maintain computerized records without redundant entries.
